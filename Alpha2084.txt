Enemy Types (36:00 - 57:00)

Passive:  
Electrodes
	- Different types on different levels
	- Universally deadly to player
	- Can be destroyed by shooting (? Exceptions ?)
	- Static, unmoving

Active: 
Grunts
	- Simple hunting behaviour
	- Only interested in player
	- Only weapon is contact
	- Destroyed by shooting

Hulks
	- Random(ish) movement
	- Alternates between wandering, hunting human family
	- Indestructable
	- May be fended off / influenced by shooting (knockback effect)
	- Destroys human family upon contact

Spheroid / Enforcer / Sparks
	- Spheroid spawns enforcers (how many until it disappears?)
	- Spheroid is deadly to player, may be shot
	- Oscillating animation makes spheroid more difficult to hit
	- Enforcer shoots sparks at player
	- Enforcer does not animate (at all?  floating enemy)
	- Sparks are directed at player's position
	- Sparks have curvature to their path that makes them difficult to track accurately
	- Sparks have variable speed - the further from the player when created, the higher their velocity (acceleration)
	- Sparks do not disappear when striking a wall, but rather "slide" along the surface for a short time, becoming effective obstacles

Brains / Progs / Cruise Missiles
