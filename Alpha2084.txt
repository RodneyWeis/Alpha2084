Enemy Types (36:00 - 57:00)

Passive:  
Electrodes 36:00
	- Different types on different levels
	- Universally deadly to player
	- Can be destroyed by shooting (? Exceptions ?)
	- Static, unmoving

Active: 
Grunts 37:00
	- Simple hunting behaviour
	- Only interested in player
	- Only weapon is contact
	- Destroyed by shooting
	- Large grunt wave on levels ending in 9 (and 4?)  Grunt x 128, player may be mobbed

Hulks 43:00
	- Random(ish) movement
	- Alternates between wandering, hunting human family
	- Indestructable
	- May be fended off / influenced by shooting (knockback effect)
	- Destroys human family upon contact

Spheroid / Enforcer / Spark 45:00
	- Spheroid spawns enforcers (how many until it disappears?)
	- Spheroid is deadly to player, may be shot
	- Oscillating animation makes spheroid more difficult to hit
	- Enforcer shoots sparks at player
	- Enforcer does not animate (at all?  floating enemy)
	- Sparks are directed at player's position
	- Sparks have curvature to their path that makes them difficult to track accurately
	- Sparks have variable speed - the further from the player when created, the higher their velocity (acceleration)
	- Sparks do not disappear when striking a wall, but rather "slide" along the surface for a short time, becoming effective obstacles

Brain / Prog / Cruise Missile 51:00
	- Brains search out human family members
	- Humans that are touched are reprogrammed into Progs, which then attack the player
	- "Mikey Bug" existed whereby brains would preferentially seek Mikey human characters at the beginning of the wave (54:00)
	- Brains shoot an indirect "cruise missile" that seeks out the player via a circuitous route
	- Appear on levels ending in 5 and 0
	- Large opportunity for player to score heavily, due to abundance of human family members

Quark / Tank / Cannonball 56:00 
	- Quarks are similar to spheroids - square instead of round, but still spawn enemies (quantity?)
	- Quarks oscillate in a manner similar to spheroids
	- Tanks maintain distance from player
	- Tanks shoot "cannonballs" (unsure of exact term) - round projectiles
	- Cannonballs may be aimed directly at player, or "banked" off a wall in a deliberate, aimed fashion

=======================================

Human Family (Discussed throughout, see 42:00)
	- Three distinct characters; Mommy, Daddy and Mikey
	- Functionally identical, apart from Mikey bug noted above
	- Progressive reward system for saving family members:
		- Each level / player death the reward resets
		- Rescued humans are worth 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000 points
		- Subsequent humans are worth an additional 5000 points, until the next level or player death
	- As noted above, spawned in large numbers on Brain levels (5, 0)

=======================================

General Considerations

Player Lives
	- Player has a set number of initial lives
	- Player receives a bonus life each 25000 points
	- Rescuing 7 human family members yields 28000 points, with each subsequent 5 family members yielding an additional 25000 points
	- The player loses a life upon contact with any enemy type, including electrodes, progs and projectiles
